1.  ***Even Or Odd Without Using Arithmetic Operators
2.  ***Number Is Power Of Two In Constant Time
3.  ***Swapping Two Numbers Without a Third Variable
4.  ***Swapping Two Numbers Without a Third Variable And Arithmetic Operators.
5.  ***Two Numbers Are Equal Or Not Using Bitwise Operators
6.	WAP to print sum of first n natural numbers using for loop
7.	WAP to print factorial of a number using for loop.
8.	WAP to print multiplication table of a number.
9.	WAP to print sum of even numbers between 1 and N.
10.	WAP to check if a number is prime or not.
11.	WAP to print numbers in reverse. (E.g from 10 to 1)
12.	WAP to print first n Fibonacci numbers.
13.	WAP to find Nth Fibonacci number
14.	WAP to calculate power of a number using for loop.
15.	FizzBuzzProgram ->>> Print numbers from 1 to n. For multiples of 3, print “Fizz”, for multiples of 5, print “Buzz” and for multiples of both print “FizzBuzz”.
16.	WAP to check if a number is palindrome.
17.	WAP to find sum of digits of a number.
18.	WAP to count digits in a number.
19.	WAP to reverse a given number.
20. ***WAP to check the given number is perfect number or not.
    A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors (excluding the number itself).
    Examples:
    6 is a perfect number
    Proper divisors: 1, 2, 3 → 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
    28 is a perfect number
    Proper divisors: 1, 2, 4, 7, 14 → 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28
21. ***WAP to find the GCD of two positive integers.
    Input: It should accept two positive integers.
    Output: It should print the GCD.
    Example:
    Input: 36 60
    Output: 12
    Hint: Use the Euclidean Algorithm.
22. ***WAP to find the LCM (Least Common Multiple) of two positive integers.
    Hint: LCM = (a*b) / GCD(a,b)
23. WAP to count the total number of divisors of a given integer.
